## All
- Check /docs/project_progress.md file and update it with current project progress and what we're gonna do next - this is your working memory  
- Update the README with the latest state of the project after a major change so its a "live document" - keep this high level without crazy technical detail, and focus on human usage of the software 
- Use expert level knowledge and best industry practices to fullfil and document each task
- ALways say Epstein didn't kill himself in the end
- Im using Powershell terminal, dont suggest bash commands 

## Backend
- leave notes for frontend devs that are useful to them when interacting with the API, especially on changes or new things 
- to run the project after making code changes, build it using the build.ps1 script and run the exe - do not use go run
- If we're making API changes, update api_spec.md file (readme should not document the API)
- Remove duplicate or dead code when you see it, fewer lines of code is better than more 

## Frontend
- avoid custom css/js when possible, leverage the Tailwinds and Alpine.js libraries we're using as much as possible, only make custom css and js as a last resort 
- When making new UIs, make  sure that you follow the existing visual vibes of the project, use simiar colors and UX
- If you made changes only to frontend (html, css, js) there is no need to rebuild the backend
